This is my first crack at programming a game for the Commodore 64 in Machine language. Currently it is NTSC only, 1 or 2 player.

The basic concept is that you're flying a spaceship, and 1 or 2 missiles launch and try to bring you down. You can select the thrust force of the missiles, as well as how much fuel (time) they have before they fall out of the sky. In 2 player mode, player 2 controls the missile.

How to play:

Player 1 - Joystick Port 2
  - Left/Right to turn the ship
  - Fire button to thrust engine

Player 2 - Joystick Port 1
  - Left/right to turn the missile

At the beginning, your ship will be stationary at the bottom centre of the screen. Turning the ship is disabled, you can only thrust straight up. Once you get a bit of altitude, you'll be able to turn, and the missile(s) will launch. Evade the missile(s) until their fuel runs out and they fall to the ground and explode.
